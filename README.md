# Are We There Yet?

A drop-in pocket app for a single day or a whole trip. Point Claude at
photos of a paper schedule, an event map, or a printed itinerary, and it
fills in one `event.json`. The app renders that into an installable PWA with
a live schedule, an arrival countdown and progress bar, a map with find-me
GPS, and an offline itinerary. It runs fully offline once installed, so it
works in a field or a national park with no signal.

This began as a fork of Operation Callahan (a one-off Cedar Point trip app)
and grew into a reusable thing for any day-to-week outing. The name is the
question every kid asks from the back seat.

## The idea

The app code never changes. A single `event.json` describes the whole thing:
title, dates, timezone, location with GPS, the schedule (one day or many),
and every place on the map. Swap that one file and you have a different event.

The hard part, turning a photographed schedule, map, or itinerary into clean
structured data with real GPS coordinates, is done by Claude (or any capable
AI). See [NEW-EVENT.md](NEW-EVENT.md) for the exact workflow and prompt.

```
  📷 photos of schedule / map / itinerary  ->  🤖 Claude OCR + geocode  ->  event.json  ->  📱 installable PWA
```

## One day or many

- **Single day** (a camp, a conference, a wedding): one date, one schedule.
  The bundled `event.json` is the Bear (Popsicle Pirates) track at PAC Summer
  Blast Adventure WEST, St. John's Northwestern Academy, Delafield WI.
- **Multi-day** (a vacation, a road trip, a festival weekend): a `days[]`
  array, each with its own date, schedule, and places. A day switcher appears,
  the header shows "Day 2 of 5" or a countdown to the trip, and the map
  filters to the selected day. See
  [`samples/vacation.json`](samples/vacation.json) for a 3-day Door County
  example.

Single-day files need no `days[]`. A flat top-level `schedule` is treated as
a one-day trip, so old files keep working.

## What the app does

Three tabs, no backend, no build step.

- **Schedule** - A live "right now / up next" banner with a countdown, a
  "how much of the day is done" progress bar, and the day as a timeline. On
  the event day it opens focused on the current block, highlights it, and dims
  finished ones. A pulsing "up in 5 minutes" nudge tells you when to move, and
  optional reminders can notify you before each activity. Every block links to
  its spot on the map with one-tap walking directions. On trips, a day
  switcher scrolls across the top.
- **Map** - A Leaflet map with a colored pin for every stop (activities, food,
  lodging, sights, services). "Find me" drops your live GPS and names the
  nearest stop, "Mark my car" saves where you parked, "Save offline" caches
  the visible tiles so the map keeps working with no signal, and tapping any
  pin lets you jot a note.
- **Kids** - The back-seat tab that earns the app its name. A big glanceable
  "Are we there yet?" answer with a car driving along a road toward the finish,
  a kid-worded countdown ("7 minutes until Bottle Rockets"), and a talking
  button that says the answer out loud. Kids collect a sticker for every stop
  they reach (with confetti), and three offline boredom-busters are built in:
  Bingo, Spot It, and I Spy.
- **Info** - Location and Open-in-Maps, an Add-to-Calendar export (.ics), a
  Share button, where you're staying, a saved packing checklist, live weather,
  reminder controls, a light/dark appearance toggle, and good-to-know notes.

Times respect the event's `timezone`, so a trip in another zone still shows
the right clock. The whole thing installs to the home screen and works offline.

## Run it locally

Plain static HTML. No npm needed to run it.

```
npx serve .
# or
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000`. Geolocation works on `localhost` and on
HTTPS (like GitHub Pages), but browsers block it on plain `file://` URLs.

To preview the multi-day sample: `cp samples/vacation.json event.json` (then
restore with git when done).

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

Pages is HTTPS, so GPS, reminders, and installability all work with no backend.

1. Push to `main`.
2. In the repo, go to **Settings > Pages > Build and deployment**.
3. Set **Source** to "Deploy from a branch", pick `main`, folder `/ (root)`,
   and **Save**.
4. Wait about a minute. The live URL is `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`.

The `.nojekyll` file disables Jekyll so `assets/` serves. Keep it.

## A note on reminders

Reminders are best-effort local notifications: they fire while the installed
app is running or recently backgrounded, with no server involved. Always-on
push (delivered hours later with the app fully closed) would need a small
backend with the Web Push protocol, which this static app intentionally does
not include.

## Make it your own day or trip

1. Read [NEW-EVENT.md](NEW-EVENT.md).
2. Photograph the schedule, map, or itinerary.
3. Hand the photos to Claude with the prompt in that file. You get a fresh
   `event.json` (single-day or multi-day).
4. Drop it in, bump `CACHE` in `sw.js`, update `manifest.json`, and redeploy.

## Files

| File | What it is |
|------|------------|
| `index.html` | The entire app: shell, three tabs, map, live clock, day switcher, timezone logic, PWA wiring. Data-driven, never edited per event. |
| `event.json` | The one file that describes a day or a trip. Swap this to change events. |
| `samples/vacation.json` | A 3-day multi-day trip example. |
| `manifest.json` | PWA metadata (name, icons, colors). |
| `sw.js` | Service worker. Caches the shell, `event.json`, and any tiles you save offline. |
| `gen-icons.js` | Regenerates the app icons via Playwright. |
| `NEW-EVENT.md` | How to turn photos into a new `event.json` with Claude. |
| `SPEC.md` | The `event.json` schema, field by field. |
| `.nojekyll` | Lets GitHub Pages serve the `assets/` folder. |
